# Description

This project demonstrates a production-style DevOps workflow for a backend Spring Boot application.
It features a full CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate building, testing, and containerizing the application with Docker.
The resulting Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub and deployed to an AWS EC2 instance using a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner, ensuring repeatable and reliable deployments.
